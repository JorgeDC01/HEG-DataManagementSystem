combination of characters is asked by a rich businessman saito to infiltrate his dying competitors son robert fischers dream and place an idea in his mind so that saitos business can become more successful traveling through the layers of someones mind and making them think of an idea on their own is what they call inception cobb is dedicated to making this happen so that saito can arrange for cobbs return to america to see his children without saito cobb would not be able to return to america because of his alleged criminal background but saito has connections and power to clear his name some members of his team think achieving inception is impossible but cobb convinces them to be on board and they must come up with a mastermind plan with no room for error to achieve this extremely difficult yet imperative task they begin a threelayer plan that involves elaborate depths of the dream dimension taking advantage of fischers sensitive and dysfunctional relationship with his father practiced methods of leaving a dream and entering the next all while trying to avoid cobbs wife mal who lives in his subconscious and often sabotages his plans the shocking ending leaves viewers at a cliffhanger and fans theorizingnow that ive gone over the plot lets talk about the other components of the film the marketing strategies did an excellent job gathering hype for the film the movie poster features the famous actors that everyone was excited to see leonardo dicaprio tom hardy elliot page and the rest of the dream crew it also says inception in a large red font and notes that is directed by the same director of dark knight which was an insanely successful and highly rated movie that was premiered two years prior to inception dark knight scored a 94 on rotten tomatoes and is 112 on imbds most popular movie list this likely drew in the audience from christopher nolans movies and set a high expectation for the quality of inception another great marketing move was the contents of the teaser trailer the trailer features a brief voiceover of leonardo dicaprio and amazing scenes with impressive cinematography taken out of context that show the viewers the production value and exciting action contents of the film all while confusing them so that they go see the film when it is released i think the shock factor and science fiction aspect of the trailer is owed to the scene where a city block starts to fold over top of itselfthe content of the film stayed true to the marketing because the cinematography directing and acting is quite welldone starting with the cinematography the zero gravity scenes and cityscape building from the ground up were very realistic looking and intensified the movie watching experience there was a lot of attention to detail the directing of inception is very montage based it draws amounts and amounts of suspense for example the montage near the end of the film with the van the fortress and the hotel was painfully long but created such thick suspense for the acting i only have compliments and no complaints inception was casted beautifully and everyone fit their roles perfectly leonardo dicaprio did an excellent job as dom cobb especially in the emotional scene with his wife and two kids in one of the dreams my personal favorite performance was cillian murphys role as robert fischer he played as his character really well and he captured his relatively constant sadness surrounding his father situationinception is a staple film in the science fiction genre and is similar to a few other scifi movies as well inception is at 135 on imbds most popular movie list and has a rating of 87 on rotten tomatoes so there is no doubt about its quality in my opinion inception is pretty similar to the wellloved movie the matrix 1999 starring keanu reeves they are both iconic science fiction and action films with themes of alternate realities the second film i think is very similar is a more recent film tenet 2020 with robert pattinson tenet is also about bending the rules of science and is also directed by christopher nolan if you enjoyed either of these movies i recommend inception i also recommend it to general fans of christopher nolans directing so if you have watched and enjoyed any of his films you would probably like inception tooon my rating scale of one to five with one being the worst possible score and five being perfect i give inception a five it has no weaknesses in my opinion every aspect of this movie combines into perfection the acting and cinematography is what takes it over the top and i am a fan of leonardo dicaprio and cillian murphy in all of the roles they play this is a movie i have voluntarily watched multiple times and it only gets better with each watch it is very complex and a complete experience to view my favorite aspect of the film is the ending many people say they hate cliffhangers but i enjoy them because it leaves it up to the audience to imagine basically you can choose your own ending based on what you think makes the most sense with the facts you are given in the film\"\n",

poster features the famous actors that everyone was excited to see leonardo dicaprio tom hardy elliot page and the rest of the dream crew it also says inception in a large red font and notes that is directed by the same director of dark knight which was an insanely successful and highly rated movie that was premiered two years prior to inception dark knight scored a 94 on rotten tomatoes and is 112 on imbds most popular movie list this likely drew in the audience from christopher nolans movies and set a high expectation for the quality of inception another great marketing move was the contents of the teaser trailer the trailer features a brief voiceover of leonardo dicaprio and amazing scenes with impressive cinematography taken out of context that show the viewers the production value and exciting action contents of the film all while confusing them so that they go see the film when it is released i think the shock factor and science fiction aspect of the trailer is owed to the scene where a city block starts to fold over top of itselfthe content of the film stayed true to the marketing because the cinematography directing and acting is quite welldone starting with the cinematography the zero gravity scenes and cityscape building from the ground up were very realistic looking and intensified the movie watching experience there was a lot of attention to detail the directing of inception is very montage based it draws amounts and amounts of suspense for example the montage near the end of the film with the van the fortress and the hotel was painfully long but created such thick suspense for the acting i only have compliments and no complaints inception was casted beautifully and everyone fit their roles perfectly leonardo dicaprio did an excellent job as dom cobb especially in the emotional scene with his wife and two kids in one of the dreams my personal favorite performance was cillian murphys role as robert fischer he played as his character really well and he captured his relatively constant sadness surrounding his father situationinception is a staple film in the science fiction genre and is similar to a few other scifi movies as well inception is at 135 on imbds most popular movie list and has a rating of 87 on rotten tomatoes so there is no doubt about its quality in my opinion inception is pretty similar to the wellloved movie the matrix 1999 starring keanu reeves they are both iconic science fiction and action films with themes of alternate realities the second film i think is very similar is a more recent film tenet 2020 with robert pattinson tenet is also about bending the rules of science and is also directed by christopher nolan if you enjoyed either of these movies i recommend inception i also recommend it to general fans of christopher nolans directing so if you have watched and enjoyed any of his films you would probably like inception tooon my rating scale of one to five with one being the worst possible score and five being perfect i give inception a five it has no weaknesses in my opinion every aspect of this movie combines into perfection the acting and cinematography is what takes it over the top and i am a fan of leonardo dicaprio and cillian murphy in all of the roles they play this is a movie i have voluntarily watched multiple times and it only gets better with each watch it is very complex and a complete experience to view my favorite aspect of the film is the ending many people say they hate cliffhangers but i enjoy them because it leaves it up to the audience to imagine basically you can choose your own ending based on what you think makes the most sense with the facts you are given in the film\"\n",
