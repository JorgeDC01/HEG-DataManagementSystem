This movie has both a love affair and the war drama you would expect from a movie about an American sniper, but neither really catches on. The part of the movie in between deployments doesn't really do anything for the story, and it really reduces the overall impression of this movie. It seems as though this part of the movie hasn't really received as big an effort as the parts when he is deployed in Iraq. The combat scenes are very convincing, they reminded me of Black Hawk Down, and you really can't put a finger on those parts. All in all this is a movie worth while seeing, and it will quite possibly demand an emotional reaction, but then it is soon forgotten. Maybe if i were American and had a sense of American patriotism, i would rate this movie a bit higher.\",\n          \"I guess this is a fictional retelling of actual events. The character of Frank (Denzel Washington) is the story of a man, who because of his own issues with the abuse of being a black man with few prospects, driven to become \\\"great.\\\" Unfortunately, his greatness is tied up in exporting pure heroin from Vietnam and selling it. He is a murderer, a liar, and every way a criminal. He is charming on the outside and deadly on the inside. There is no way that a thinking person could admire him. If his vendetta and his business were directed only at bad guys, we might think that it is OK. But he kills indiscriminately, many dying as innocent victims. Russell Crowe's prosecutor is determined and insightful. He is himself a loner (a role Crowe does well at in many films), but he must butt heads all the way along. He has committed a \\\"crime.\\\" He has found and returned thousands of dollars in drug money found on a case. He is seen as a bit of an idiot and hence not on of \\\"the guys.\\\" Everything plays out well. Two masterful actors doing what they do best. I think my most memorable scene is the one where they come upon the poppy fields in Vietnam where this stuff is being cooked and dried. It would be like going to SonyCorp or some big Asian business; but this is a factory used to make one of the most destructive substances. See this because it is a fascinating story and it is masterfully done.\",\n          \"Four Edinburgh friends Mark Renton (Ewan McGregor), Daniel \\\"Spud\\\" Murphy (Ewen Bremner), Simon \\\"Sick Boy\\\" Williamson (Jonny Lee Miller), and psychopath Francis Begbie (Robert Carlyle) are into the low life heroin addicted junkie world. Renton tries to quit with a couple of final rectal suppositories. He steals clean-cut friend Tommy MacKenzie (Kevin McKidd)'s sex tape with his girlfriend. He chases after Diane Coulston (Kelly Macdonald) from the club but he finds out that she's underage after sleeping with her. The guys go back to doing heroin. Even Tommy starts doing it after dumped by his girlfriend for losing the sex tape.Director Danny Boyle gives a flashy, densely-packed, dark and hilarious vision of the drug life. It is disturbing and funny, sometimes at the same time. It doesn't promote drug use despite some criticism to that fact. The grim and ugliness should dissuade people from using. It is a wild ride and something unique.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

       "  'review': 'it is a rarity for a film to be completely unsettling and yet unrelentingly grippingdavid finchers story takes place in a bleak and constantly raining city never named where urban decay and sleaze in all forms are rampant coming up to his retirement from the police force is detective lieutenant somerset morgan freeman who is tasked with breaking in his replacement detective sergeant mills brad pitt before leaving somerset is world weary under no illusions about the futility of the daily role he plays and initially wants nothing more than to escape the grime and violence of the city mills on the other hand is convinced that he is going to make a real difference having voluntarily transferred to this precinct bringing his wife to the city with him before somerset can move on a homicide comes in which he and mills are assigned to investigate but its only the first of a string of ritual murders that will be committed by a killer who is basing his crimes on the seven deadly sins as depicted in dantes the divine comedyto begin with se7en appears to be a standard cops on the trail of a killer story which shouldnt be too difficult for the audience to get comfortable with but as we descend along with the characters into the merciless brutal world without hope that they inhabit you are left reeling at the events that unfoldthe two detectives enjoy an uneasy relationship with no real friendship ever striking up between them the older somerset is educated astute and gives the impression of being emotionally burnt out mills who has no respect for somersets methodical investigating gets excited at the thought of solving a murder and firmly believes that the good guys will win eventually the further we get into the action the might of the evil that they face pushes both men beyond their limitsthis film draws heavily on biblical themes and you can certainly see similarities with such films as the seventh seal 1957 both films show the price that good men have to pay when they fight evil and the unsettling truth that the rule book goes straight out the window when you are dealing with something so diabolical that it has no boundaries or limits at allse7en shows us a world which has been destroyed by its own sins a wasteland in which values are minimal the killer having nothing but contempt for this world sees it as his mission to expose the faults and show everyone what they have become it is a fascinating twist that when the killers motives become clearer somerset with his greater understanding actually feels some degree of empathy with him this is lost on mills though whose level of clarity never reaches the same pointa previous reviewer mentioned that you begin to expect the unexpected whilst watching se7en and i completely agree eventually if you think of the most obvious outcome in any situation and predict that the opposite will happen it usually does even the finale itself became kind of predictable because by then you are conditioned not to have any hope this is a minor flaw though because the story is so well and so shockingly tolddirector david fincher didnt pick up another script for 18 months such was his exhaustion and frustration following the completion of alien 3 apparently he agreed to direct se7en after one reading of andrew kevin walkers screenplay because he was drawn to its hard hitting delivery about inhumanity he stated its psychologically violent it implies so much not about why you did but how you did it for the camera work specially altered film stock was used to make the visuals look as dark and unsettling as possible which is complemented well by howard shores music scorethe most disturbing message that se7en puts across is that the fight against evil is destined to be a pyrrhic victory but regardless the only thing we can do is fight on whatever the cost we have no other choicethe world is a fine place and worth fighting for i agree with the second part'}}"
